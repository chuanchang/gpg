Description: Bindings to GPG for managing keys and creating / verifying OpenGPG
    (RFC4880) signatures. On Windows and macOS the binary package includes a copy
    of gnupg1 which supports basic signature operations. However more advanced 
    features (such as elliptic curves) require installation of gnupg2 from e.g. 
    homebrew or GPG4Win.
